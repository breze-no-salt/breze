class Trainer(object):
    """Class representing a Trainer.

    A Trainer object is used to ease bookkeeping of fitting models. This is done
    by composing a trainer out of several basic strategies.

    `Scoring strategy`: The way the score is calculated can be determined by
    the callable stored in the ``_score`` field. For some examples, see the
    module ``breze.learn.trainer.score``.

    `Reporting strategy`: For a report function that is applied to each info
    dictionary during a pause when calling ``.fit()``, ``.report`` can be set.
    For examples, see the module ``breze.learn.trainer.report``.

    `Pause criterion`: When to pause optimization of the model to yield
    control back to the user. Determined by the ``.pause`` field. Contains a
    callable, for example see ``climin.stops``.

    `Interrupt criterion`: When to interrupt optimization of the model to
    yield control back to the user. Determined by the ``.interrupt`` field.
    Contains a callable, for example see ``climin.stops``.

    `Stopping criterion`: When to interrupt optimization of the model to
    yield control back to the user. Determined by the ``.stop`` field.
    Contains a callable, for example see ``climin.stops``.

    Why do we need separate stopping and interrupting criteria? An
    optimization might get interrupted (e.g. by a SIGINT of a shared resource
    system). In order to find out whether the trainer thinks optimization has
    actually finished, the ``.stopped`` field is provided.


    Attributes
    ----------

    model : Model object
        Model that is going to be trained by this trainer.

    _score : callable
        Callable that applies a score function to data. Signature is
        ``f_score, *data``.

    pause : callable
        Callable that given a climin info dictionary determines whether to pause
        fitting.

    stop : callable
        Callable that given a climin info dictionary determines whether to stop
        (i.e. finish) fitting.

    interrupt : callable
        Callable that given a climin info dictionry determines whether to
        interrupt fitting.

    report : callable
        Callable to which the info dictionary of the current optimization is
        passed during each pause.

    best_pars : array_like
        Currently best found parameters according to validation data.

    best_loss : float
        Loss on the validation data of ``best_pars``.

    infos : list of dicts
        List containing all info dictionaries of the estimation.

    current_info : dict
        Last info dictionary.

    eval_data : dictionary
        Dictionary of different data sets for evaluation.

    val_key : string
        Key identifying the data set from ``eval_data`` which is used for
        validation.

    stopped : boolean
        If ``stop`` has returned True once, this is set to True. Otherwise
        False. Useful for distinguishing between interrupt and stop.
