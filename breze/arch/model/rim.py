    ----------

    posterior : Theano variable
        Array of the shape ``(n, d)``. The array describes ``n`` catgorical
        distributions over ``d`` categories. Each row has thus to sum up to 1

        Each of the items is a Theano variable that is being penalized with its
        squared L2 norm.

    c_rim : float
        Weight of the L2 penalties.
